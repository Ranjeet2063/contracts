  auto-closes it on merge.

## Regression tests

> **Required for every bugfix.**
> If this PR closes an issue, it must include at least one test that would
> have caught the original bug — a test that fails on `main` before the fix
> and passes after. Add it to `src/regression_tests.rs` (or the relevant
> `#[cfg(test)]` module) with a doc comment that names the issue:
>
> ```rust
> /// Regression test for #N — <one-line description of the original bug>.
> #[test]
> fn test_regression_issue_N_<short_name>() { … }
> ```
>
> If no regression test is needed (e.g. pure docs or chore), explain why
> in the "Testing notes" section below.
