## [Unreleased]

### Fixed — build and test suite restored

The workspace did not compile and the test suite had never run. Both are now green.

- **`alert-registry` did not build at all.** `panic_with_error!` was used without
  being imported, and `register_alert` returned a bare `u64` from a function
  declared `-> Result<u64, ContractError>`. No WASM artifact could be produced
  from this repository before this change.
- **`Cargo.lock` was git-ignored** while the toolchain was pinned to Rust 1.85,
  so every clean checkout re-resolved dependencies and eventually picked crates
  requiring Rust 1.88 — failing before compilation began. The lockfile is now
  committed, the workspace declares `rust-version`, and the MSRV-aware resolver
  (`resolver = "3"`) keeps resolution inside the pinned toolchain.
- **CI built the whole workspace for `wasm32`**, which pulled `test-utils` in and
  force-enabled soroban-sdk's `testutils` (requires `std`) on a `no_std` target.
  WASM builds now target the two contract crates explicitly.
- All CI invocations use `--locked` so dependency drift fails loudly instead of
  silently changing what is built.
- The test suite compiles and passes for the first time: **169 tests**, plus
  `clippy -D warnings` and `cargo fmt --check` clean.

### Security

- **RUSTSEC-2026-0009 (`time`)** — the advisory scan could not run at all
  (cargo-audit needs rustc >= 1.88) and the patched `time` release needs the
  same, so the 1.85 pin made the advisory unfixable. The toolchain is bumped to
  1.90.0 with a declared MSRV of 1.88, `time` is updated to 0.3.55, and the
  audit runs as its own CI job on stable so it is never coupled to the
  contracts' MSRV again. The crate reaches the workspace only through
  `soroban-ledger-snapshot` (host/test tooling) and is not part of the deployed
  `wasm32` artifact.

### Fixed — correctness

- **`update_alert` silently discarded rule validation.** It called
  `validate_rules` and dropped the returned `Result`, so an alert could be
  updated with rule descriptors that `register_alert` rejects. Now propagated.
- **`update_webhook` accepted webhook hashes of any length**, while
  `register_alert` required exactly 64 characters. Both now enforce the same rule.
- **`replace_watcher` could drop the replacement watcher.** Corrected so the new
  address is always added when it was not already registered.
- `configs_paginated` could overflow on `offset + limit`; now saturating.
- `AlertRegistry::transfer_admin` emitted no event, leaving a change of control
  invisible on-chain. It now emits `("admin", "transfer")`.

### Added

- **Two-phase webhook rotation** — `propose_webhook` stages a new hash in the new
  `AlertConfig::pending_webhook_hash` field without disturbing the live webhook;
  `confirm_webhook` promotes it and clears the pending slot, returning the new
  `ContractError::NoPendingWebhook` when no rotation is in progress. This
  behaviour was already specified in `docs/alert-registry.md` and covered by
  tests, but had never been implemented. Emits `alert.wh_prop` / `alert.wh_conf`.
- **`renew_alert_ttl`** — owner-authenticated TTL extension that leaves
  `updated_at` untouched, so renewing storage does not make an alert reappear in
  `get_alerts_modified_since` incremental syncs.

### Removed

- `contracts/alert-registry/src/{contract,storage,types}.rs` — 857 lines of a
  second, divergent `AlertRegistry` implementation that was never declared as a
  module and therefore compiled into nothing.
- Root-level `task1.md`, `task2.md` and `issue.md` scratch notes (the first two
  described work already shipped; the third contained the word "test").
- **Feature A — `watcher.remove` event**: `WatcherRegistry::remove_watcher` now emits
  `(Symbol("watcher"), Symbol("remove"))` with `data = watcher: Address` **only when the
  watcher was actually present** (no-op removals are silent). Dependent systems such as
  `AlertRegistry` watcher-gating must subscribe to this event to revoke trust immediately.
  `clear_all_watchers` emits one event per removed watcher for the same reason.
- **Feature B — configurable TTL via `bump_alert`**: `AlertRegistry` now exposes
  `bump_alert(config_id, ttl)` which extends the TTL of an alert and its associated
  indexes up to `MAX_TTL` (535 680 ledgers ≈ 31 days). Values above the cap are silently
  clamped. No auth is required — any address (e.g. an off-chain keeper) may call it.
  Emits `(Symbol("alert"), Symbol("bump"))` with `data = (id: u64, effective_ttl: u32)`.
- `DEFAULT_TTL` constant (17 280 ledgers ≈ 24 hours) replaces the previous hardcoded
  100-ledger value across all `extend_ttl` calls in `alert-registry`.
- `MAX_TTL` constant (535 680 ledgers ≈ 31 days) as the protocol-enforced ceiling for
  caller-specified TTL values.
- `WatcherRegistry::is_authorized` alias for `is_watcher_authorized` (backwards compat).
- `WatcherRegistry::clear_all_watchers` bulk-deauthorizes all watchers in one admin call,
  emitting a `watcher.remove` event for each removed address.
- `WatcherRegistry::decrement_watcher_count` is now correctly called on `remove_watcher`
  (previously the count only ever incremented — this was a bug fix).
- `alert.bump` event documented in `docs/events.md`.
- `watcher.remove` event marked ✅ implemented in `docs/events.md`.
- `docs/ttl.md` updated to document `DEFAULT_TTL`, `MAX_TTL`, and `bump_alert`.

### Fixed
- `WatcherRegistry::remove_watcher` no longer emits an event when the watcher address
  was not registered (previously always emitted regardless).
- `WatcherRegistry::get_watcher_count` now decrements correctly on removal.
- `AlertRegistry::remove_alert` body was missing in `lib.rs` (structural corruption);
  restored with correct `remove_alert_record` call.
- `AlertRegistry::remove_alert_by_admin` was missing from `lib.rs`; restored.
- `AlertRegistry::register_alert` had duplicated validation calls; deduplicated.
- `AlertRegistry::update_alert` now keeps `DataKey::AlertActive` in sync when `active`
  changes.
- `contract.rs` `#[contract]` / `#[contractimpl]` attributes removed to prevent
  duplicate Soroban client generation conflicting with `lib.rs`.
- All `extend_ttl(_, 100, 100)` calls replaced with `extend_ttl(_, DEFAULT_TTL, DEFAULT_TTL)`.
