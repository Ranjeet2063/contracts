# Contributing

## Prerequisites

Install the Rust toolchain and Soroban target:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Install the Stellar CLI:

```bash
cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt
```

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

The workspace minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is **1.88**, as declared in the root `Cargo.toml` (`rust-version = "1.88"`).

- **CI Enforcement:** Verified continuously on every pull request and push to `main` via the `msrv` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running `cargo check --workspace`.
- **Bump Triggers:** MSRV is only bumped when strictly required by a necessary dependency update (e.g., newer `soroban-sdk` releases) or essential compiler features.
- **Policy & Cadence:** MSRV bumps are not made casually. Any increase is considered a breaking change, documented in `CHANGELOG.md`, and accompanied by a corresponding update to `rust-version` in `Cargo.toml` and CI configuration.

## Build

```bash
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Test

Run tests with the provided script to ensure consistent dependency resolution across your local environment and CI:

```bash
./scripts/test.sh
```

Alternatively, use `cargo test` directly (with `--workspace --locked` for CI consistency):

```bash
cargo test --workspace --locked
```

Tests run natively (no WASM target needed). Each contract has a `#[cfg(test)]` module covering happy paths, unauthorized rejections, and edge cases. The `scripts/test.sh` script passes any additional cargo arguments through, so you can run:

```bash
./scripts/test.sh --package alert-registry    # Run tests for one contract
./scripts/test.sh -- --nocapture              # Show output from passing tests
```

## Deploy to Testnet

1. Set up a funded testnet identity:

```bash
stellar keys generate deployer --network testnet
stellar keys fund deployer --network testnet
```

2. Run the deploy script:

```bash
bash scripts/deploy.sh
```

3. Update `DEPLOYMENTS.md` with the printed contract addresses.

## Verifying a Deployment

Verify that a deployed on-chain contract matches the locally compiled WASM binary:

1. Run the verification script against the target contract and network:

```bash
# Verify Alert Registry on Testnet
bash scripts/verify.sh --contract alert-registry --contract-id <ALERT_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID> --network testnet

# Verify Watcher Registry on Testnet
bash scripts/verify.sh --contract watcher-registry --contract-id <WATCHER_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID> --network testnet
```

2. For mainnet verification, ensure `MAINNET_RPC_URL` is exported:

```bash
export MAINNET_RPC_URL="https://mainnet.stellar.validationcloud.io/v1/<API_KEY>"
bash scripts/verify.sh --contract alert-registry --contract-id <ALERT_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID> --network mainnet
```

The script compiles the contracts locally in release mode, calculates the local SHA-256 hash, retrieves the deployed WASM hash from the network via Stellar CLI, and asserts that they match.

## Upgrading a Deployed Contract

Upgrade an already-deployed contract to a new WASM binary:

1. Ensure the deployer identity is configured and funded (defaults to `deployer`, or customize via `STELLAR_IDENTITY`):

```bash
export STELLAR_IDENTITY=deployer
```

2. Run the upgrade script for the target contract:

```bash
# Upgrade Alert Registry
bash scripts/upgrade.sh --contract alert-registry --contract-id <ALERT_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID> --network testnet

# Upgrade Watcher Registry
bash scripts/upgrade.sh --contract watcher-registry --contract-id <WATCHER_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID> --network testnet
```

3. For mainnet upgrades, export `MAINNET_RPC_URL`:

```bash
export MAINNET_RPC_URL="https://mainnet.stellar.validationcloud.io/v1/<API_KEY>"
bash scripts/upgrade.sh --contract alert-registry --contract-id <ALERT_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ID> --network mainnet
```

The script builds the contract locally, installs the new WASM on-chain via `stellar contract install`, and invokes the contract's `upgrade` function with the new WASM hash.

4. Update `DEPLOYMENTS.md` with the new WASM hash and version details.

## Adding a New Function to an Existing Contract

1. Add the function inside the `#[contractimpl]` block in `contracts/<name>/src/lib.rs`.
2. If it mutates state, call `<caller>.require_auth()` as the first line.
3. Add at least one test in the `#[cfg(test)]` module covering the happy path and any auth rejection.
4. Run `cargo test` to confirm everything passes.
5. Update the relevant documentation to prevent documentation drift:
   - If this emits a new event, update `docs/events.md`.
   - If this adds a storage key, update `docs/storage.md`.
   - If this changes TTL behavior, update `docs/ttl.md`.
   - Update contract-specific documentation in `docs/<contract-name>.md`.
6. Note: An automated doc-sync check (issue #110) runs in CI as a backstop to catch cases where these manual documentation steps are missed.

## Adding a New Contract

When scaffolding an entirely new contract crate in this repository, follow these steps (see `contracts/alert-registry` as a complete worked reference):

### 1. Create Crate Structure & Workspace Registration
Create a directory under `contracts/<contract-name>` with `src/lib.rs`, `Cargo.toml`, and `build.rs`. Register the new crate in the root `Cargo.toml` under `[workspace] members`:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[workspace]
members = [
    "contracts/alert-registry",
    "contracts/watcher-registry",
    "contracts/<contract-name>",
    "contracts/integration-tests",
    "contracts/test-utils",
]
```

### 2. Configure Contract `Cargo.toml`
Set up `contracts/<contract-name>/Cargo.toml` with the appropriate crate types and workspace dependencies:

```toml
[package]
name = "<contract-name>"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
rust-version.workspace = true

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]

[dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { workspace = true }

[dev-dependencies]
soroban-sdk = { workspace = true, features = ["testutils"] }
```

### 3. Add `build.rs`
Copy or create `build.rs` in the contract crate root to ensure compatibility across target OS/environments (e.g., Windows/GNU export-table limit):

```rust
// contracts/<contract-name>/build.rs
fn main() {
    if std::env::var("CARGO_CFG_TARGET_OS").as_deref() == Ok("windows")
        && std::env::var("CARGO_CFG_TARGET_ENV").as_deref() == Ok("gnu")
    {
        println!("cargo:rustc-link-arg=-Wl,--exclude-all-symbols");
    }
}
```

### 4. Scaffold TypeScript Bindings Package
1. Create `bindings/<contract-name>/` with `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `.npmignore` (refer to `bindings/alert-registry/`).
2. Generate bindings using the Stellar CLI:
   ```bash
   stellar contract bindings typescript \
     --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/<contract_name>.wasm \
     --contract-id <CONTRACT_ID> \
     --output-dir bindings/<contract-name> \
     --overwrite
   ```

### 5. Update CI Workflows and Deploy Scripts
1. **CI Build & Checks:** Add `-p <contract-name>` to the WASM build steps in:
   - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`Build (WASM)` step)
   - `.github/workflows/wasm-size-check.yml`
   - `.github/workflows/publish-bindings.yml` (and add bindings generation step)
   - `.github/workflows/publish-abis.yml`
2. **Deployment Script:** Update `scripts/deploy.sh` to include the contract in the optimization loop (`stellar contract optimize`) and add deployment/initialization commands for testnet and mainnet.
3. **Documentation:** Add a dedicated contract reference under `docs/<contract-name>.md`.

## Documentation Guidelines

- **`docs/` directory:** Reserved strictly for durable, evergreen reference material (e.g., architecture guides, storage layouts, event catalogs, protocol specifications, API references).
- **PR summaries & changelog notes:** Do not commit temporary per-PR summaries or change descriptions directly into `docs/`. PR details belong in GitHub pull request descriptions, and notable changes should be added to `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Cutting a Release

Releases follow a specific two-phase trigger sequence due to how GitHub Actions workflows are structured:

1. **Git Tag (`vX.Y.Z`)** triggers `.github/workflows/deploy-testnet.yml`, which compiles the contracts, deploys them to Stellar testnet, updates `DEPLOYMENTS.md`, and opens a pull request with the new addresses.
2. **GitHub Release (`published`)** triggers `.github/workflows/publish-abis.yml` and `.github/workflows/publish-bindings.yml`, which generate the JSON ABIs, upload them to the release assets, and generate/publish the TypeScript npm bindings.

Because these triggers are decoupled, releases must follow the sequence below in exact order.

### Release Sequence

1. **Prepare Release**
   - Ensure all target PRs are merged to `main`.
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` by moving items from `[Unreleased]` to a new version header `[X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`,
     then add a `[X.Y.Z]: https://github.com/Tx-wats/contracts/compare/vPREV...vX.Y.Z` link and point
     `[Unreleased]` at `compare/vX.Y.Z...HEAD`. The release workflows run
     `scripts/check-changelog-release.sh` first and fail if the tag has no such section;
     run it locally with `bash scripts/check-changelog-release.sh vX.Y.Z`.
   - Commit and push changes to `main`.

2. **Create and Push Git Tag**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

3. **Verify Testnet Deployment & Merge Addresses**
   - Monitor the **Deploy to Testnet** workflow on GitHub Actions.
   - Once completed, review and merge the automated PR (`deploy/update-deployments-vX.Y.Z`) into `main`.

4. **Publish GitHub Release**
   - In GitHub, navigate to **Releases** → **Draft a new release**.
   - Select the existing tag `vX.Y.Z`.
   - Set the title to `vX.Y.Z` and paste the release notes from `CHANGELOG.md`.
   - Click **Publish release**.

5. **Verify Automated Publishing**
   - Monitor the **Publish Contract ABIs** and **Publish TypeScript Bindings** workflows triggered by the published release.

### Release Verification Checklist

- [ ] `vX.Y.Z` tag created and pushed to remote repository.
- [ ] `Deploy to Testnet` workflow completed successfully.
- [ ] Automated `deploy/update-deployments-vX.Y.Z` PR reviewed and merged to `main`.
- [ ] GitHub Release `vX.Y.Z` created and published using the tag.
- [ ] `Publish Contract ABIs` workflow passed and attached ABI JSON files (`alert-registry.json`, `watcher-registry.json`) to the release.
- [ ] `Publish TypeScript Bindings` workflow passed and published the latest package to npm.

## Repository Hygiene & Ephemeral Files Policy

- **No Ephemeral PR/Audit Markdown Files:** Do not commit transient PR descriptions, temporary lint fix summaries, or point-in-time audit notes (such as `CLIPPY_*.md` or `issue-*-audit.md`) to the repository root or `docs/`.
- **Permanent Placement:** Lasting architectural notes belong in `docs/`, release notes belong in `CHANGELOG.md`, and code fix rationale belongs directly in git commit messages and GitHub pull request bodies.

## Merge Policy

### Branch Protection on `main`

The `main` branch is protected. A pull request **cannot be merged** unless all
of the following conditions are met:

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **`ci` passes** | Full Rust build, tests, Clippy, formatting, README snippet check |
| **`msrv` passes** | Workspace compiles cleanly on Rust 1.88 |
| **`Check WASM binary sizes` passes** | Optimised WASM outputs stay under 60 KB |
| **Branch is up to date** | The PR branch must be rebased or merged against the current `main` tip before merging, so semantic merge conflicts are caught before they land |

These checks correspond to the `ci`, `msrv`, and `wasm-size` jobs in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/wasm-size-check.yml`.

### Why

Issues #179–#192 showed that PRs #160–#175 were merged while the workspace did
not compile. CI was running on every PR but the checks were not *required*, so
GitHub allowed merging regardless of outcome. Every contributor who branched off
`main` after those merges inherited a broken tree. Requiring green CI closes
that gap.

### What to do if your PR is blocked

1. **CI failed** — fix the failure, push a new commit, and wait for CI to re-run.
   The checks are re-evaluated on every push to the PR branch.
2. **Branch is out of date** — update your branch against the latest `main`:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main   # or: git merge origin/main
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```
3. **Flaky check** — if a check failed for a clearly unrelated infrastructure
   reason (network timeout, rate limit), re-run it from the GitHub Actions UI.
   Do not merge around the failure.

### Setting up branch protection (maintainers)

If you need to re-apply the branch protection rule (e.g. after a repo transfer),
run the following with a PAT that has `repo` → `administration` write scope:

```bash
gh api \
  --method PUT \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  /repos/wendyamoni-creator/contracts/branches/main/protection \
  --input - <<'EOF'
{
  "required_status_checks": {
    "strict": true,
    "contexts": [
      "ci",
      "msrv",
      "Check WASM binary sizes"
    ]
  },
  "enforce_admins": true,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": null,
  "restrictions": null
}
EOF
```

`"strict": true` enforces the up-to-date requirement.
`"enforce_admins": true` means repository admins are also subject to the rule.
