# Deployments

This file tracks deployed contract addresses for each network.  
After running `scripts/deploy.sh`, replace the placeholder values with the printed addresses and commit the update.

> **Address format:** Stellar contract addresses are 56-character strings beginning with `C`  
> (e.g. `CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABSC4`).  
> Testnet addresses are only valid until the next testnet reset.
