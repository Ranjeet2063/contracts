# TTL Values and Storage Expiry

## What is TTL in Soroban?

Soroban persistent storage entries have a **Time-To-Live (TTL)** measured in **ledgers**. Once an entry's TTL reaches zero, the Stellar network archives it and it becomes inaccessible until restored via a fee-paying restore operation.

## Current TTL Configuration

All persistent storage entries in `alert-registry` use a **default TTL of
17 280 ledgers (~24 hours)**:

```rust
// DEFAULT_TTL = 17_280  (~24 hours at 5 s/ledger)
env.storage().persistent().extend_ttl(&key, DEFAULT_TTL, DEFAULT_TTL);
```

This applies to:
- `DataKey::Alert(id)` — individual alert configs
- `DataKey::AlertActive(id)` — per-alert active flag
- `DataKey::OwnerIndex(address)` — per-owner alert ID lists
- `DataKey::ContractIndex(address)` — per-contract alert ID lists

The `watcher-registry` uses **instance storage**, which has its own TTL managed by the network and is not explicitly extended in the current implementation.

## Configurable TTL via `bump_alert`

Callers can extend the TTL of any alert up to the **protocol maximum of
535 680 ledgers (~31 days)** by calling `bump_alert`:

```rust
// Extend alert 42 to the maximum lifetime (~31 days)
alert_client.bump_alert(&42u64, &535_680u32);

// Or pass u32::MAX — it is silently clamped to MAX_TTL
alert_client.bump_alert(&42u64, &u32::MAX);
```

The function:
1. Clamps the requested TTL to `MAX_TTL` (535 680 ledgers).
2. Extends `Alert`, `AlertActive`, `OwnerIndex`, and `ContractIndex` entries.
3. Emits an `("alert", "bump")` event with `(id, effective_ttl)`.

No auth is required — any address (e.g. an off-chain keeper service) may
bump an alert's TTL without modifying its content.

## Wall-Clock Time Estimate

Stellar ledgers close approximately every **5 seconds**.

| Ledgers | Approximate wall-clock time |
|---------|-----------------------------|
| 100     | ~8 minutes 20 seconds       |
| 1,000   | ~1 hour 23 minutes          |
| 17,280  | ~24 hours (DEFAULT_TTL)     |
| 120,960 | ~7 days                     |
| 535,680 | ~31 days (MAX_TTL)          |

**The default TTL of 17 280 ledgers keeps an alert alive for ~24 hours after
the last write.**  Use `bump_alert` to extend beyond that without modifying
the alert's content.

## When Does the TTL Reset?

The TTL is extended on every mutating call that touches the entry:

| Function              | Entries extended |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| `register_alert`      | `Alert(id)`, `AlertActive(id)`, `OwnerIndex`, `ContractIndex` |
| `update_alert`        | `Alert(id)`, `OwnerIndex`, `ContractIndex` |
| `update_webhook`      | `Alert(id)`, `OwnerIndex`, `ContractIndex` |
| `update_label`        | `Alert(id)`, `OwnerIndex`, `ContractIndex` |
| `update_target_contract` | `Alert(id)`, old and new `ContractIndex` |
| `bump_alert`          | `Alert(id)`, `AlertActive(id)`, `OwnerIndex`, `ContractIndex` |
| `remove_alert`        | Entry is deleted (no TTL needed) |

Read-only functions (`get_alert`, `get_alerts_for_contract`, `get_alerts_by_owner`) do **not** extend the TTL.

## Implications

- **Inactive alerts expire quickly.** An alert that is registered but never updated will be archived after ~8 minutes.
- **Watchers must keep alerts alive.** Any off-chain service relying on alert data should periodically call `update_alert` (or a dedicated bump function) to prevent expiry.
- **Archived entries are not deleted.** They can be restored via `RestoreFootprintOp`, but this requires paying a fee and is not currently automated.

## Recommendations

For production use, the TTL should be increased significantly. Common choices:

| Use case | Suggested TTL (ledgers) | Wall-clock |
|----------|------------------------|------------|
| Short-lived alerts | 17,280 | ~24 hours |
| Standard alerts | 120,960 | ~7 days |
| Long-lived alerts | 535,680 | ~31 days |

To change the TTL, update the `extend_ttl` calls in `contracts/alert-registry/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
// Example: extend to ~7 days
env.storage().persistent().extend_ttl(&DataKey::Alert(id), 120_960, 120_960);
```
